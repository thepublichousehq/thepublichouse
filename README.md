# The Public House: Discover Independent Blogs

## Project Scope

The Public House (thepublichouse.org) aims to be a website that aggregates and recommends high-quality, independent blogs.  It will curate content for readers interested in insightful perspectives and diverse voices outside the traditional media landscape. The target audience is makers, builders, data scientists, and other curious people looking to move away from the closed web of paywalls and social media and towards openly sharing ideas and projects with others.

The platform focuses on "independent blogs," defined as websites meeting the following criteria:

*   Owned and operated by individuals or small groups.
*   Focused on creating original content, not reposting or aggregating.
*   Not hosted on corporate blogging platforms (e.g., Medium, Dev.to, Substack) or social media.
*   Not corporate blogs. The content is created and managed by individuals or small teams, reflecting their own views and expertise.

## Project Objectives

*   **Curate a Diverse Collection:** Build a searchable, browsable database of independent blogs across various topics.
*   **Develop a Robust Classification System:** Create an algorithm to identify and verify independent blogs based on the defined criteria.  This system will ensure that only truly independent blogs are included in the platform.
*   **Facilitate Content Discovery:** Implement a recommendation engine to connect readers with relevant, high-quality blogs. The engine will consider reader preferences and blog characteristics to provide personalized recommendations.
*   **Provide an Enjoyable Reading Experience:** Offer a clean, user-friendly interface optimized for reading and browsing blog content.  The platform will prioritize readability and ease of navigation.
*   **Foster a Community:** Explore features that encourage interaction between readers and blog authors. This could include comment sections, forums, or other interactive elements.
